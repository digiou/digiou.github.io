My research interests lie in the intersection of IoT, sensor-cloud query processing, and in-network data management. I investigate ways to further scale data management systems even when they operate in last-mile networks. I collaborate with [Varun Pandey](https://www.bifold.berlin/people/dr-varun-pandey.html) and [Steffen Zeuch](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/zeuchste/). 

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I had industry experience on working with data management and data-related systems in [multiple positions](https://www.linkedin.com/in/demetrios-giouroukis/). 

I received my MSc in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki under the supervision of [Dimitrios Vrakas](https://intelligence.csd.auth.gr/people/vrakas/) where I had the pleasure to work with [Moysis Symeonides](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moysis-symeonides-13bb02b2/). I did my BSc in [University of Peloponnese](https://www.uop.gr/en/) under the dual supervision of [Christos Tryfonopoulos](http://users.uop.gr/~trifon/) and [Nikos Platis](https://users.uop.gr/~nplatis/en/).
